      <p class="researchplan">In order to assess the needs of our user base it was important to gather quantitative data in the form of a survey as well as qualitative data through interviews.Â  Our team developed a survey that was distributed via social media networks in order to reach a broad audience. At the same time, we also conducted one on one interviews with the intention to gain a better understanding of unmet needs.</p>

      <p>As the results came in, we noticed that on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being not at all difficult and 5 being extremely difficult to talk about mental health, 27 of 39 participants rated the level as difficult or above. That lead us to continue working with the mental health app.</p>

            <br>Weâre better because we believe that creating and app like WeMind will offer a safe and supportive community to finally make it easier to get the right kind of help at the right time.</br>
            <br>Weâre believable because we will allow people to have a positive impact in their personal and professional life all while helping others to do the same. In helping themselves they will also be contributing to a happier and healthier society.</br>
